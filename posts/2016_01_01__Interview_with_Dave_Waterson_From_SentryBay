This is the first in a series of posts where I will have someone who is a professional or an expert in their field talk a bit about their field, area of expertise and challenges in their field. After those questions, I'll have the person recommend at least five resources that someone can pick up and get involved and started in their field.
<ol>
	<li>Tell me a little bit about yourself and the field you're in.</li>
</ol>
I am CEO of <a href="http://www.sentrybay.com/">SentryBay</a>, a company that develops information security solutions. I founded the company in 2002. We develop security solutions for PC and Mac, mobile (Android and iOS), the cloud, networks and IoT. Our head office is in London, UK, where our core development team is based, and we also have staff in the USA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our brand is not well known as our route to market is through our partners – our products are generally re-branded for our partners – so end users typically know the name of the re-branding rather than the name SentryBay.

	<li>What is your main area of focus in your field?</li>
</ol>
Within the information security arena, our areas of particular expertise are anti-key logging, anti-phishing and secure browsing. We have US patents in technologies we have invented in these specific areas, around which we have built a range of products. Around a decade ago, we realised that traditional anti-virus solutions built on signature-based scanning techniques could never solve the problem. Signature-based scanning works only against known malware, and will always be ineffectual against the latest, newly-developed attacks. We set about designing security solutions that focus on protecting sensitive data, even when the device itself may be infected. As we now have ten years experience in this technology, our solutions in anti-key logging, anti-phishing and secure browsing are regarded as industry-leading and being rolled out to end users by some of the largest companies in the world.
<ol start="3">
	<li>What are some of the key challenges and problems you face?</li>
</ol>
As the company grows, it is important that we continue to hire the right people. We are planning significant growth in our development and QA teams during 2016, as well as additions to business development staff. As our field is very specific, we generally can’t hire staff with exactly the technical knowledge they will need, so we create an environment where key staff can develop and grow on the job. This is particularly true in emerging areas such as IoT. Our staff turnover is very low, as most generally find it a very stimulating environment – our technical team develop leading-edge solutions that are literally rolled out to millions of users. This in itself is rewarding.

	<li>Can you recommend a few resources, either books, online courses, papers, etc., that someone can pick up to get started in doing what you do? And if possible, cam you give a few words about why you chose each resource?</li>
</ol>
As CEO, part of my role involves key input into the strategic direction of the company. It is important therefore that I look ahead and spend time focussing on emerging developments and technologies. The titles in my bookcase that stand out and that I would recommend include:

One of the most important certifications is the CISSP awarded by (ISC)<sup>2</sup>. Although several years relevant work experience is required before the CISSP is awarded, it should be a goal of all who are serious about a career in information security. The certification covers a broad understanding of many of the basics in the field such as access control, network security, risk management, secure software development, cryptography, secure architecture, and disaster recovery planning. Although there are several texts covering the CISSP syllabus, I recommend this study guide by Eric Conrad because it is concise.</li>
